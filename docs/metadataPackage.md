# metadataPackage JSON File

The input to our `dr2-ingest` Step Function includes an S3 URI to a JSON file describing the package to be ingested below the Preservation System folders for the series. The JSON file contains a single array of objects, where each object represents a folder, Asset, or File within the package.

There are 4 types of object supported within the package;

- `ArchiveFolder` - Represents a folder created to manage archival hierarchy. When ingesting, if a folder already exists in the Preservation System with the given `id` the metadata of that folder is updated if a new `title`, `description`, or `id_` fields are given.
- `ContentFolder` - Represents a folder that was included within the transfer. These folders are passed to the Preservation System but will not update metadata on subsequent ingests (process managed by the Preservation System).
- `Asset` - Represents a record or information object. The asset is the granular entity within our processes; we ingest, process, and report on asset activities.
- `File` - A digital file or bitstream within an Asset.

The hierarchy of these types is enforced, ArchiveFolder and ContentFolder can repeat recursively but ArchiveFolders cannot be children of ContentFolders. The root node(s) of an ingest package can be of type ArchiveFolder, ContentFolder, or Asset. All objects within the array **MUST** have a valid `parentId` property referencing another object within the array or a `series` property.

A metadataPackage containing a top level folder or Asset `A` with series `ABC 123` would be placed at `ABC/ABC 123/A` in the Preservation System. If the series is not known, set the series as `Unknown` to place the item at `Unknown/A`.

| title       | no       | The title of the folder. On ingest the title of the folder in the Preservation System is set to this value if present, on subsequent ingests the title is only updated if a `title` is given.                         |
| type        | yes      | The item type (`ArchiveFolder`).                                                                                                                                                                                      |
