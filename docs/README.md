Digital Records Repository is the Preservation Service for digital and digitised records within The National Archives. Digital records are stored, actively preserved, and accessed using a commercial off-the-shelf digital preservation managed service. Around this service we have built a control mechanism to facilitate ingest of and access to digital objects.

We have divided our architecture into logical components, each with corresponding documentation.
