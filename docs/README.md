# Digital Records Repository Documentation

![Diagram of DR2 components in AWS](/docs/images/dr2-end-to-end.svg)

Digital Records Repository (DR2) is the Preservation Service for digital and digitised records within The National Archives. Digital records are stored, actively preserved, and accessed using a commercial off-the-shelf digital preservation managed service. Around this service we have built a control mechanism to facilitate ingest of and access to digital objects.

We have divided our architecture into logical components, each with corresponding documentation.

- [Court Document Preingest](/docs/preingest-court-documents.md)
- [TDR Preingest]()
- [Ingest](./ingest.md)

And our decision-making has been documented through [Architecture Decision Records](./architecture-decision-records).
