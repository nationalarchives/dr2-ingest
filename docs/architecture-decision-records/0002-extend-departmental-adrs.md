# 2. Extend departmental ADRs

**Date:** 2023-06-29

## Context

Within our organisation, architectural decision records (ADRs) are used at the department level to document and track architectural choices across various projects. These departmental ADRs serve as a valuable resource for capturing and communicating architectural decisions across teams. However, it is important to recognise that certain projects may have unique architectural considerations and requirements that warrant the creation of project-specific ADRs in addition to the departmental ADRs.

## Decision

For this project, we have decided to create project-specific ADRs in addition to the departmental ADRs to capture and document architectural decisions that are specific to this project.

## Consequences

**1. Consistency with Departmental ADRs:** Despite having project-specific ADRs, it is essential to ensure consistency with the departmental ADRs where applicable. Project-specific ADRs should align with the overarching architectural principles and guidelines established at the department level to maintain coherence and prevent conflicts or duplication.

**2. Documentation Overhead:** Creating project-specific ADRs in addition to departmental ADRs incurs additional documentation overhead. Project team members should be mindful of this effort and strike a balance between capturing essential decisions and avoiding unnecessary duplication or verbosity. Effective communication and collaboration should be encouraged to share relevant information between project-specific and departmental ADRs.

**3. Awareness and Accessibility:** Project team members should be aware of both the project-specific ADRs and the departmental ADRs. Adequate measures should be taken to ensure the accessibility and visibility of project-specific ADRs within the project team and relevant stakeholders. Integration with project documentation repositories or knowledge management systems can facilitate access to these records.
