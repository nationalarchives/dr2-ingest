# 1. Record architectural decisions

**Date:** 2023-06-29

## Context

In the development of complex software systems, it is crucial to make well-informed decisions regarding architectural choices. These decisions can have a significant impact on the system's quality attributes, such as maintainability, scalability, and extensibility. To ensure transparency, traceability, and effective communication among team members and stakeholders, it is important to establish a structured approach for capturing and documenting these architectural decisions.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the practice of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), [as described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), to document and track architectural decisions made throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Consequences

**1. Documentation Effort:** The adoption of ADRs requires a conscious effort to document architectural decisions promptly. This effort should be integrated into the development process to ensure that decisions are captured in a timely manner.

**2. Maintenance and Accessibility:** ADRs should be regularly maintained and kept up-to-date as the system evolves. Accessibility to ADRs should be ensured, allowing easy retrieval and reference by team members and stakeholders. Integration with project documentation repositories or knowledge management systems may be necessary to achieve this.

**3.Transparency:** The motivation behind previous decisions is visible for everyone, present and future. Nobody is left scratching their heads to understand, "What were they thinking?" and the time to change old decisions will be clear from changes in the project's context.
